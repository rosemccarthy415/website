    <p>Now we will go over the most commonly accepted Nuu-Chah-Nulth alphabet. There are 45 letters in the alphabet, some sound the same as in English and others might be new to you. There are a few sounds in the Nuu-Chah-Nulth alphabet that are completely unique.</p>
    <h1 style="font-size:18px;border: 6px solid #0066cc;text-align:center;">Vowels</h1>
      <p style="border: 2px solid black">

      <p>long a</p>
      <p>short e</p>
      <p>long e</p>
      <p>short i</p>
      <p>long i</p>
      <p>short o</p>
      <p>long o</p>
      <p>short u</p>
      <p>long u</p>
      <p>These vowels and their sounds will allow you to practice the other sounds in the alphabet with the sound drills created by hinatinyis, a learner and teacher of the East Barkely dialect. A good way to practice stretching the long vowels and learning to differentiate short and long vowel sounds is to clap while you speak the language. One clap for a short vowel and clap twice while you're stretching a long vowel. Remember when you begin to speak words and sentences that you can stretch a long vowel for as long as you want but a short vowel must be short or you will change the meaning of what you're saying.</p>
